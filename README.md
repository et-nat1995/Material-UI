# Practicing react with Material-UI

A react app meant for learning new concpets with react.

Following along with a udemy course and adding what I learned into this application on during the process.

`npm/yarn start ` Is not required in the root directory to run server.js. This app doesnt have a backend yet.

The curency converter part of the app was built as a front end to a Java bases micro-services backend for a co-worker.
